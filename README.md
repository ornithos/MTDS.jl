# MTDS.jl: Multi Task Dynamical Systems implementation

This is a consolidated implementation of my multi-task dynamical system (MTDS) models developed during my phd and coded up over various corners of my github repos.

This is a work in progress and so there's not much point in me providing documentation as yet. However, see [example MT-LDS notebook](./notebooks/mtlds-example.ipynb) for a deep dive into some introductory linear dynamical system examples.
